### Why is golang?
if we talking about current stage of computer software and hardware and why we need go like language, so we have some software as well as hardware limition issues. At software side we must install dependencies for creating a small http server along with HTML parser or sometimes dependency required for parsing json or xml. 
If we want to run some routines in python we must install asyncio library but in go we have built-in routines functions which is known as go routines. And we can easily getting outputs from it just using special type of data type that is known as channel. 
On the other end we occurs some hardware limition issues when we working over threads we are using cores and it's cache and we adding more and more as per requirements after that our product cost were higher than high but in golang has some great functionalities like garbage collectors test in race and so on which is executing at time of compiling for hardware betterment.
Go runs directly on underlying hardware. It's likes c++ and much closer in syntx. 

### Blockchain
Now a days blockchain is pretty hot term. when we heared just we think about golang so i decide to code a blockchain on golang. It's really good idea and works faster than other languages.

### BoltDB
This database system is a native database which is contains buckets. In buckets we store our informations.

### NATS.IO Messaging Queue 
This was written in ruby but now developers wrote in golang with using channel and goruotines feature.

### gRPC
I tried to make a simple microservice over gRPC. for getting further information please visit [grpc_example folder](https://github.com/shakirmengrani/golang_examples/tree/master/grpc_example). 

### Container
As we know that docker, kubernetes and CoreOS is written in golang, I should tried to make something like this for making better infrasturcture for my own microservices.
