### Blockchain
Now a days blockchain is pretty hot term. when we heared just we think about golang so i decide to code a blockchain on golang. It's really good idea and works faster than other languages.

This database system is a native database which is contains buckets. In buckets we store our informations.

### NATS.IO Messaging Queue 
This was written in ruby but now developers wrote in golang with using channel and goruotines feature.
